- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jack17-bit.
- 👀 I am interested in Information Tecnology and I study it for this reason.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning the programming languages html, css, javascript, bootstrap and MySQL.
- 💞️ I try to collaborate on any project proposed by others and I complete it in the best way possible.
- 📫 How to reach me to mail: cichellojack@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: My pronouns are many but everyone calls me Jack, Strefezza and Giacomino.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In 1968, Spencer Silver accidentally invented a weak adhesive instead of a strong one. A colleague, Art Fry, used it to create the sticky notes that became the famous Post-it Notes. This shows how often a mistake can turn into a great                invention, simply by looking at a problem from a new perspective.
